Load-Bearing Wall Assessment:
NON-LOAD-BEARING Walls (confirmed):

Interior Partition walls (92mm Stud) - The IFC properties explicitly indicate LoadBearing: False for these walls
Interior Plumbing wall (152mm Stud) - Also marked as LoadBearing: False

POTENTIALLY LOAD-BEARING Walls:

Exterior walls (Brick on Block) - While the IFC property shows LoadBearing: False, these exterior walls have Function: 1 (exterior function) and typically carry structural loads in multi-story residential buildings
Party Wall (CMU Residential Unit Dividing Wall) - This CMU (Concrete Masonry Unit) wall with Function: 5 (party wall) is typically load-bearing as it separates residential units and often supports the structure above

Summary:
The interior partition and plumbing walls in room A203 are NOT load-bearing. However, the exterior walls and party wall are more complex - while tagged as non-load-bearing in the model properties, their construction type (brick on block and CMU) and function suggest they likely do carry structural loads.

The IFC model does not contain explicit live load capacity information for the first floor (Level 1).

Level 1 contains 10 floor slabs, including:

127mm Slab on Grade
150mm Exterior Slab on Grade
Various finish floor types (wood and ceramic tile)


All slabs are marked as load-bearing (LoadBearing: True in the Pset_SlabCommon property set)
Structural properties present but limited:

Thickness values (0.127m, 0.150m)
Area and volume calculations
The slabs are marked as non-structural in the Revit structural properties (Structural: False), which may indicate they're architectural floors rather than structural slabs



Why the information might be missing:

Not exported from the source software - Live load design criteria are often maintained in the structural engineering software but not always exported to IFC
Stored elsewhere - This information might be in separate structural engineering documents, specifications, or building code compliance documents
Model purpose - If this is an architectural coordination model, structural design loads may not have been included

Recommendations:
To find the live load capacity for Level 1, you should:

Check the original structural engineering drawings and specifications
Review the building code requirements for the building's occupancy type
Consult with the structural engineer or review structural calculations
Check if there's a separate structural analysis model with this information

4 External Doors (doors A101-A102, B101-B102): Also have the same fire rating designation of ""Fire Rating""

Important Note:
The fire rating property in this IFC model appears to be set to a placeholder text value ""Fire Rating"" rather than a specific rating designation (like ""30 minutes"", ""60 minutes"", ""FD30"", ""FD60"", etc.). This suggests that either:

The actual fire rating specifications need to be populated in the model with specific values
The fire ratings are documented elsewhere in the project documentation

Plasterboard (16mm) on each side
Metal stud layer (41mm) on each side
Two concrete block layers (193mm each) - the primary fire-resistant components

The rigid insulation layer is positioned between the exterior brick veneer and the concrete block backing, with an air cavity separating the brick from the insulation. This is a common construction method that provides both thermal performance and moisture management.
The total thickness of the insulation is 50mm (approximately 2 inches), which provides the thermal barrier for the building envelope.Wiederholen";WAHR;Directly accessible information
arc;duplex;Are there any thermal bridges identified in the model?;Information not available in the BIM model.;"Based on my analysis of the IFC model, no thermal bridges have been identified or explicitly modeled in this building model.
Search Results:

❌ No IfcThermalBridge entities found
❌ No thermal-related properties (such as U-values, R-values, thermal transmittance)
❌ No thermal-related connection elements or annotations

What This Means:
The IFC model (Schema: IFC2X3) contains the basic building elements—56 walls, 21 slabs, 1 roof, 24 windows, 14 doors, and other structural components—but lacks specific thermal bridge information or energy analysis data.
Thermal bridges typically occur at:

Wall-to-floor junctions (56 walls + 21 slabs could have potential bridges)
Wall-to-roof connections (where walls meet the roof)
Window and door openings (38 total openings)
Structural penetrations (beams, columns through building envelope)
Balcony or canopy connections

Recommendations:
To identify and analyze thermal bridges in this building, you would need to:

Export the geometry to dedicated energy analysis software (e.g., THERM, HEAT3, or building energy modeling tools)
Add thermal properties to materials and building elements
Perform thermal bridge calculations at critical junctions
Document findings back into the IFC model as property sets

Would you like me to help you identify potential thermal bridge locations based on the building geometry, or would you like to add thermal analysis properties to the model?Wiederholen";WAHR;Insufficient information
arc;duplex;What is the air tightness rating of the building envelope?;Information not available in the BIM model.;"Based on my thorough search of the IFC model, the building envelope does not have an air tightness rating specified.
The IFC model for this Duplex Apartment (Project 0001) contains the following information:
Building Properties Found:

Project Name: Duplex Apartment
Project Number: 0001
Number of Storeys: 4
Category: Duplex (Code: 11-16 21 11)

Air Tightness Information:
❌ Not available - The model does not contain any air tightness properties.
Typical air tightness data that would be expected but is missing includes:

Infiltration rate (ACH or m³/(h·m²))
Blower door test results (ACH50 or n50 values)
Air leakage values for the building envelope

This type of performance data would typically be stored in:

Pset_BuildingCommon property set
Custom energy or thermal performance property sets
Building envelope-specific property sets

Note: This appears to be an architectural model that focuses on geometry and spatial information rather than detailed building performance metrics. Air tightness ratings are usually added during energy modeling or after blower door testing has been conducted.Wiederholen";WAHR;Insufficient information

}Based on my thorough search of the IFC model, the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) is not defined for the windows in this model.
Here's what I found:
Window Information Summary
The model contains 24 windows of various types:

Fixed windows (various sizes: 2800mm x 2410mm, 819mm x 759mm, 750mm x 2200mm, 4835mm x 2420mm)
Casement windows (819mm x 759mm)
Skylights (1180 x 1170mm)

Available Thermal/Glazing Properties
The windows have the following property sets defined:

Pset_WindowCommon - Contains basic properties like Reference, IsExternal, FireRating
PSet_Revit_Type_Materials and Finishes - Lists materials (Frame, Sash, Glass)
PSet_Revit_Type_Other - Contains a ""GlazingAreaFraction"" property, but its value is just the property name itself (not a numerical value)

Missing Data
The Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) is not included in any property set in this IFC file. To properly analyze thermal performance, this data would need to be added to the model, typically in:

The Pset_WindowCommon property set, or
A custom thermal performance property set

If you need SHGC values for energy analysis, you would need to either:

Obtain this information from the window manufacturer specifications
Add it to the IFC model using property set editing tools
Use typical SHGC values based on the glazing type and window construction

  However, we do know that the roofing material is an EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) membrane, and the life of EPDM membranes is typically 25 to 30 years, although it can be much longer with proper maintenance.";"Based on the IFC model in Blender, I can see there's a roof element named ""Basic Roof: Live Roof over Wood Joist Flat Roof"". However, the IFC file doesn't appear to contain specific lifespan information in its properties.
For the roofing material type ""Live Roof over Wood Joist Flat Roof"" (which appears to be a flat roof system with wood joists), here's what we can determine about expected lifespan:
General Expected Lifespans for Flat Roofing Materials:

Built-up Roofing (BUR): 20-30 years
Modified Bitumen: 20-25 years
EPDM (Rubber): 25-30 years
TPO (Thermoplastic): 20-30 years
PVC: 20-30 years

Factors Affecting Lifespan:

Quality of installation
Climate conditions
Maintenance frequency
Drainage efficiency
UV exposure
Foot traffic

Important Note: The IFC model doesn't contain explicit lifespan data in its properties. To get the exact expected lifespan for this specific roofing material, you would need to:

Check the project specifications document

Window Warranty Information - Search Results
Status: ❌ NOT FOUND IN IFC MODEL
What I Found:
The IFC model contains multiple windows of various types, including:

M_Fixed windows (various sizes: 750mm x 2200mm, 4835mm x 2420mm, 2800mm x 2410mm, 819mm x 759mm)
M_Casement windows (819mm x 759mm)
M_Skylight windows (1180 x 1170mm)
M_Single-Glass 1 windows (0813 x 2420mm)

Issue:
The IFC file does not contain warranty period information in any of the following locations:

Window instance properties
Window type properties
Window style property sets

Typical Industry Standard Warranties:
Since the specific warranty information is not in the model, here are typical window warranty periods:

Vinyl Windows: 20-30 years (limited lifetime on some brands)
Aluminum Windows: 20-25 years
Wood Windows: 10-20 years
Fiberglass Windows: 20-30 years

Glass/Seal Warranty: Typically 10-20 years for insulated glass units
Recommendations:
To find the actual warranty period for these windows, you should:

Glass doors (4 doors): There are 4 ""Single-Glass 1"" doors, which could be either interior or exterior, but given they're located on Level 1 and their size (0813 x 2420mm), they appear to be interior glass doors for offices or similar spaces

Distribution by level:

Based on the IFC model analysis, I've identified 153 structural elements across the building:

Element Inventory:
Walls (IfcWallStandardCase): 113 elements
Foundation walls (concrete): 14 elements
Exterior walls (brick/block composite): 24 elements
Interior partitions (metal stud/plasterboard): 68 elements
Party walls (CMU): 7 elements
Slabs (IfcSlab): 21 elements
Concrete slabs on grade: 4 elements
Finish floor slabs (wood, ceramic tile): 17 elements
Footings (IfcFooting): 7 elements (concrete)
Beams (IfcBeam): 8 elements (steel)
Members (IfcMember): 4 elements (stair stringers)
Material Composition:
The structural system consists primarily of:

Concrete (cast in situ) - foundations, footings, slabs
Masonry (brick and concrete block) - exterior walls
Steel (structural) - beams and framing
Wood (dimensional lumber) - floor finishes
Metal studs and plasterboard - interior partitions
Embodied Carbon Estimate:
Unfortunately, the IFC model doesn't contain quantity data (volumes) in the property sets, which makes precise calculation difficult. However, based on typical building dimensions from the bounding boxes:

Estimated ranges (using standard embodied carbon coefficients):

Concrete foundations/slabs: ~20-30 m³ → ~7,600-11,400 kgCO2e
Masonry walls: ~15-25 m³ → ~3,000-5,000 kgCO2e
Steel beams: ~0.5-1.0 m³ → ~5,800-11,600 kgCO2e
Wood floors/framing: ~2-4 m³ → ~540-1,080 kgCO2e
Interior partitions: ~10-15 m³ → ~3,120-4,680 kgCO2e
Total Estimated Embodied Carbon: ~20-34 tCO2e (tonnes of CO2 equivalent)

Recommendations for Accurate Assessment:
To get precise embodied carbon figures, the model needs:

Proper quantity takeoffs (volumes) populated in IFC property sets
Specific material specifications with EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) data
Layer thicknesses for composite assemblies
Consideration of construction waste factors

Plasterboard (34.6% of materials) - 95% recyclable, can be reprocessed into new gypsum board
Metal/Steel components (27.6% combined) - 95% recyclable through standard scrap metal recycling
Concrete & Masonry (17.5% combined) - 100% recyclable as crushed aggregate
Wood products (3.1% combined) - 85% recyclable through reuse or reprocessing

Moderately Recyclable Materials (50-84%) - 2.2% of total:

Ceramic Tile (1.3%) - 70% recyclable as crushed aggregate
Plywood Sheathing (0.7%) - 70% recyclable into particle board
EPDM Membrane (0.2%) - 50% recyclable through specialized programs

Limited Recyclability (<50%) - 7.4% of total:

Unit B Panelboard Total Demand: 1,636,782 W (1,636.8 kW)
Total Building Electrical Demand: 3,275,501 W (3,275.5 kW)

Estimated Annual Energy Consumption:
Using a typical assumption of 30% average utilization factor (accounting for day/night cycles, seasonal variations, and actual usage patterns), the estimated annual energy consumption would be approximately:

Sheet Vinyl or VCT (Vinyl Composition Tile) - most common for sterile processing areas
Epoxy flooring - for chemical resistance
Seamless rubber flooring - for easy cleaning and infection control

To get the exact flooring type specified for this space, you would need to:

Plasterboard finish - 16mm (exterior/one side)
Metal stud framing - 92mm (structural core)
Plasterboard finish - 16mm (interior/other side)

The partition walls between the treatment rooms are a standard metal stud partition, composed of two 16mm plasterboard panels with a 92mm metal stud layer. This type of wall will typically have a Sound Transmission Class (STC) of 38-40 dB if the cavity is not filled with acoustic material.;"Based on my analysis of the IFC model, I was unable to find a specific STC (Sound Transmission Class) rating explicitly documented in the model's property sets for the walls between treatment rooms.
However, I did find the following relevant information:
Wall Types Between Treatment Rooms:

Interior - Partition (92mm Stud): 926 walls of this type

Width: 0.124m (124mm)

Conclusion:
The STC rating for walls between treatment rooms is not explicitly documented in this IFC model. The model contains fire rating information (1 HR for some walls) and structural classifications, but acoustic performance data such as STC ratings has not been included in the property sets.
For healthcare facilities, treatment room walls typically require STC ratings between 45-55 depending on the specific use and code requirements, but this information would need to be obtained from:

str;dental;What is the structural concept of the building?;The structural concept is: steel frame and concrete slabs.;"Based on my analysis of the IFC model, here's the structural concept of the building:
Structural System Overview
The building employs a beam-column frame structural system with the following characteristics:
Key Structural Elements:

738 Beams - The dominant structural element, forming the horizontal framing system
195 Columns - Vertical support elements providing load transfer to foundations
96 Footings - Foundation elements supporting the column grid
13 Slabs - Floor and roof deck systems
12 Roof elements - Roof structural components

Structural Concept:
This is a multi-story post-and-beam (frame) structure with:

Column Grid System: The columns create a regular grid pattern that supports the floors above
Beam Framework: An extensive network of beams (738 total) spans between columns to support floor slabs and transfer loads
Foundation System: Individual spread footings (96 units) at the base of each column, indicating a distributed foundation approach rather than a continuous foundation
Three-Level Structure:

TOF Footing level (foundation)
First Floor
Second Floor
Roof - Main level



The high ratio of beams to columns (nearly 4:1) suggests a system with secondary and tertiary beam framing, likely including:

Primary beams spanning between columns
Secondary beams for intermediate support
Possibly joist or purlin systems

This is a typical steel or concrete frame structure optimized for flexibility in space planning, as the columns provide discrete vertical supports rather than continuous load-bearing walls.Wiederholen";WAHR;Directly accessible information
